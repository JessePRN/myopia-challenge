# Myopia Clusters

In this assignment, you’ll apply what you learned about unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization that shares your findings. 

## Background

You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

You have been provided with raw data, so you’ll first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. You will use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, you’ll create a visualization to share your findings with your team and other key stakeholders.

## Instructions

This activity is broken down into four parts: 

* Part 1: Prepare the Data

* Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction 

* Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

* Part 4: Make a Recommendation 

## Recommendation

The optimal number of clusters seems to be 3 based on the Elbow curve, arguably 5 is worth checking out

I would absolutely argue that clusters are present, at a minimum 2, more likely 3, and potentially 4 or 5.

We only had 600 some samples, so I would absolutely suggest getting more data and performing more modeling
